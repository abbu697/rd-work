Preparation of Zeolite polymer composites:



Detailed statement:- 

Polymer recycling plays a vital role in the polymer industry. Recycling makes the industry more sustainable. Recycled products can be used in the polymer composite. There are different composites in the polymer industry. With the reinforced materials, they have better properties. There is a composite that can be formed with the help of radiated zeolite. Zeolite does have the cage-like structure. There is dislocation of bonds when it is under is radiation. Due to radiation, there is a delocalisation of bonds and the formation of voids. When it is enforced in the recycled polymer, after the formation of composite material. It does have the better chemical and mechanical properties. The final composite can be tested with the help of testing standards like iso and astm d . then these composites can be used in aeroplanes, industries and vehicles also. There has been a lot of work would be done on these types of composite by research and development orgasniations.




Significance:- 


material would be better for the industry. It will be environment friendly. It will be economical.

Final quality checks are 

There are different tests according to astm d and iso are 

Haze, clarity and environmental stress cracking test.


There are apparatus and instruments for about test. By following the standard operating procedures. These tests can be done.


 They help in understanding the composite materials. With these result, these composites can be used in different places.







Duration of project;

it would take 5 months. Experiments have to be done in world class lab. It requires times and results. 



Lastly, wth help of online library and portal. there can be books and files. which can be used for the work, One exampe is given below:
